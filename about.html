                                    <p>My name is Vincent Chau and I am currently a Junior at Seven Lakes High School. Computer Science has been an integral part of life for the past 3 years, 
                                        and I have become very passionate about the field. I started my journey in computer science as a freshman when I tried out AP Computer Science A, a simplified version
                                        of an introductory CS course, and was instantly hooked on the idea that I could solve problems by "typing characters into a text editor". I remember the first time that
                                        I typed "Hello World!" into my IDE: it was mesmerizing. Ever since, I have been continuously expanding my knowledge in Computer Science; eventually leading me to the discovery
                                        of Competitive Programming. </p>
                                    <p>During January of my sophmore year, I was introduced to the United States of America Computing Olympiad (USACO for short). After a couple weeks of practice, I took my first ever
                                        contest in February where I ICPed (in-contest promoted) to the Silver Division. Since February, I have advanced to the Gold Division where I hope by April I can finally reach the 
                                        highest level: Platinum Division. In addition to USACO, I was urged by my computer science teacher to join UIL Computer Science. With UIL Computer Science, 
                                        I competed in similar contests to USACO, but these contests were in-person and generally had 2 portions: a written test and programming contest. </p>
                                    <p>Other than Competitive Programming, I have completed a few projects mostly for my Data Structure class. Some of the projects can be accessed through my GitHub.</p>
